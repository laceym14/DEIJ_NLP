IT,Org Opportunity,Remote work is not uniform across departments and seems to be mostly dependent on the manager or VPs perception on if the persons’ job allows for remote work.
IT,Org Opportunity,"Other factors might have to take negotiating in order to be granted remote work days and having to facilitate conversations to defend their need to work remotely (financial, family, or commuting availability). "
IT,Org Opportunity,"While, other departments simply can just ask their VP for remote work and it is granted."
IT,Org Opportunity,"Political positions tend to be a topic of heated discussion, this organization identifies as a bipartisan organization but those who identify with the left/democratic/liberal side can be verbal about their beliefs and while open discussion on ones beliefs is encouraged it does take away from right/republican/conservative identifying people to feel as though they can not bring their whole selves to work for fear of retaliation and can feel as though they do not belong."
IT,Org Opportunity,The thoughts of both political sides are to be considered and valued and neither side should feel they have to hide their thoughts/beliefs for fear of exclusion from conversations or how others might perceive them. 
IT,Org Opportunity,There should be open communication but also inclusivity to all view points and for staff to be more mindful that their thoughts beliefs may be inadvertently excluding others because of this.
